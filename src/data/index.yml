about:
  - I am a Software Engineer with years of experience developing software 
    for a wide variety of applications.
  - Recently I have been working on front-end and back-end web development projects using 
    JavaScript & Python. Some of the back-end projects run on AWS, taking advantage of Lambda 
    & API Gateway.

      - I spent several years building a sales management system for a small business that 
        runs industrial & construction vehicle dealerships. The system is built on the QuickBase 
        low code platform.
      - This platform provides a graphical interface for SQL like tables. I designed all the tables as well 
        as the forms used for record operations. I also build HTML and JavaScript applications to display 
        data from a record as a printable business form.
  - title: Circuit Simulation

    p:
      - For a couple of years, I worked for a consulting organization at IBM that provided circuit design and
        simulation services.
      - One of the projects I worked on was to build an application to automate circuit simulations to 
        characterize the performance for best- and worst-case scenarios.
      - Another project was to build a logical simulator for a circuit design to prove its functionality. This 
        was needed because an electrical simulation for one input would take over 12 hours, while my logical 
        simulator could run in under a minute.

    p:
      - I stared my career working on the z/OS mainframe operating system at IBM. I performed roles in both 
        technical support and development.
      - My work was connected to the Language Environment component, which provides support for programming 
        languages. I was specifically working with support for C and C++.
      - Much of my work during this time was centered around migrations. In technical support I was helping 
        customers migrate their applications to libraries that had Y2k support. In development I was updating 
        libraries to take full advantage of 64-bit hardware.
